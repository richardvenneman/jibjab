# jQuery JibJab

For fun, I made a jQuery plugin to tick text.

## Features

- Reveal one character at a time in a target element
- Support for breathing space (gasping) with certain punctuation (currently comma's, multiple dots and EOL dots are supported)

## Examples

- [Rise and shine](http://richardvenneman.github.com/jibjab/rise-and-shine.html) (gasping enabled)
- [Berserk](http://richardvenneman.github.com/jibjab/berserk.html) (gasping disabled)

## Planned

- Specs
- Docs
- Events
- HTML tag support
- Sound effects
- Computing word breaks within container
